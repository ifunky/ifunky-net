      <description>Using SecurityHub you may come across &amp;ldquo;[EC2.8] EC2 instances should use IMDSv2&amp;rdquo; which is categorised as a high severity finding.
More info here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-ec2-8
What is this!?
Every EC2 instance contains metadata located at http://169.254.169.254 which contains details about the instance including the temporary IAM credentials used for the instance profile IAM role. There are two versions of this known as IMDSv1 and IMDSv2.V2 is a more secure version which requires tokens in order to access the metadata.</description>
